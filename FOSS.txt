11/01/18, 5:48 pm - Adil: Now since we've thrown Dev tools (which includes git) into a video, now I'm in a dillema

11/01/18, 5:49 pm - Yash K: I had his number
11/01/18, 5:51 pm - Adil: That is not the issue...

Issue is what is our standpoint?
What do we need from him? Can he provide it? It not, which terms do we agree on?

11/01/18, 5:52 pm - Kuruss: A seminar on git would be helpful too

11/01/18, 6:27 pm - Adil: A useful seminar is always useful.. üòú
11/01/18, 6:28 pm - Adil: What I mean by this is... We'll have to look into how to convert a seminar into video so that dev tools be brought into seminar...


Or explain how we could make a video of his work and show it instead
11/01/18, 7:40 pm - Paritosh: Either merge languages and practices

Or swap devtools by abhijeet with languages.
11/01/18, 8:05 pm - Khadke Sir: Give prefence to Abhijeet sir's seminar. We will discuss in college what to do about video and remaining points from devtools
